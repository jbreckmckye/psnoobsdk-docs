This is a mirror of the original documentation and PSX programmer guide for [PSNoobSDK](https://github.com/Lameguy64/PSn00bSDK).

Unfortunately the site has gone dark. This repo hosts the original docs
on GH Pages, taken from an [archive snapshot](https://web.archive.org/web/20240916202305/http://lameguy64.net/tutorials/pstutorials/index.html).
