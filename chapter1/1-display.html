<h1>1.1. Setting up Graphics and Hello World</h1>
<p>
This chapter teaches the basics of initializing and setting up the GPU of the
PSX. Areas covered in this chapter include the GPU, VRAM and the concept of
display and drawing environments which are essential for better understanding
how the GPU works when programming for the PSX.
</p>
<p>
This tutorial series does not and will not cover graphics programming using the
LIBGS library which is a high level graphics library that adds about 100KB
worth of overhead to your project (remember that the PSX only has 2MB of RAM)
and hides many of the inner workings of the GPU, making it difficult to
understand how to use the GPU directly and would often get in the way when
trying to write your own graphics routines... While it may sound elitist
discouraging the use of LIBGS as it provides facilities for rendering 3D models
easily, it is better to learn how to work with LIBGPU (or PSXGPU in PSn00bSDK)
in the long term as the knowledge gained from learning how to use it directly
will become very important in the future for either better performance, or to
accomplish special graphical effects.
</p>
<p><b>Tutorial compatible with PSn00bSDK:</b>Yes</p>

<h2 id="whystart">Why Start with Graphics?</h2>
<p>
This tutorial series begins with graphics programming as displaying a hello
world message requires a bit of graphics programming, as neither the official
SDK or PSn00bSDK provide a framebuffer text console for displaying text largely
due to the way how the hardware works. But both provide a means of basic text
drawing functions intended for debugging purposes which will be demonstrated
for this chapter.
</p>
<p>
Besides, most of the satisfaction gained when learning to develop for a new
platform comes from seeing the result displayed on the television screen by the
console you're learning to develop for and you're going need to learn graphics
programming anyway to really be able to do anything interesting with the PSX.
It is a <b>video</b> game console afterall.
</p>


<h2 id="gpusummary">Brief Summary of the GPU</h2>
<p>
The GPU, as the name suggests, is the graphics processor responsible for doing
the graphics rendering work for both 2D and 3D visuals. The block diagram shown
below illustrates the relevant components that make up the entirerity of the
PSX's graphics subsystem, including the MDEC and GTE hardware responsible for
video playback and 3D graphics capabilities respectively.
</p>
<img src="/chapter1/images/gpudiagram.svg">
<ul>
<li>1MB of VRAM with 16-bit data bus.</li>
<li>2KB of texture cache.</li>
<li>Supports non-interlaced, low resolution and interlaced, high resolution
video modes.</li>
<li>16-bit color rendering with optional dithering.</li>
<li>Draws rectangles, sprites, lines, polylines, flat, shaded and texture
mapped polygon primitives.</li>
<li>Estimated 300,000 flat and gouraud shaded polygons per second.</li>
<li>Estimated 150,000 texture mapped polygons per second.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The GPU is not 3D</h3>
<p>
A worrying amount often believed that the PSX's GPU is capable of rendering 3D
polygons. While it may seem to be the case to the uneducated, the GPU is in
fact only capable of drawing primitives in 2D space. Therefore, the GPU is
incapable of perspective correct texture mapping which results in affine
texture distortion and the occasional buggy near clipping seen in a lot of 3D
PSX games. It was common for games to minimize the distortion by subdividing
large polygons into smaller polygons with perspective correct subdivision.
</p>
<p>
The bulk of the 3D processing is instead done on the CPU which features a
co-processor suited for such tasks known as the GTE or Geometry Transform
Engine. The GTE is effectively an all integer math co-processor that provides
matrix multiplication, vector transformations and projection operations at high
speed which the CPU alone couldn't do at reasonable speed. Software would then
assemble primitive packets using results from the GTE which are then sent to
the GPU as a linked list via high speed DMA transfer for the GPU to draw said
primitives.
</p>
<p>
The GTE will not be covered in this chapter as it is not required for simple
2D graphics programming. Whilst in the topic of the GTE, a very important
issue must be taken care of and that is the GTE is <b>NOT</b> a Geometry
<i>Transfer</i> Engine. An equally concerning amount belive that the GTE 
stands for Geometry Transfer Engine and not a Transform Engine when in fact,
the GTE only does math calculations and is not capable of doing any
<i>"transfer"</i> operations whatsoever. Also, the GTE can only be accessed
by the CPU through standard co-processor related instructions. Just wanted to
clarify this before going any further in learning how to program for the PSX
as this bothers me to no end. Suppose it can be used to identify if one is a
real PSX programmer or not.
</p>

<h3>Only 16-bit Color Rendering</h3>
<p>
Some often mistake that the PSX renders graphics in 24-bit color depth. Whilst
the GPU is capable of 24-bit true color output, it cannot draw primitives in
24-bit color. So the 24-bit color mode is only really useful for MDEC video
sequences or static images in 24-bit color.
</p>
<p>
The GPU can only draw at 16-bit color depth in a RGB5I1 pixel format (five bits
per RGB component plus one mask bit used as a mask for semi-transparency
effects). This aligns perfectly with the 16-bit data bus of the VRAM.
</p>

<h3>The VRAM</h3>
<p>
The GPU features it's own 1MB of VRAM. If you look back at the block diagram
shown earlier you'll see that the VRAM is connected to the GPU and is not
connected the system bus at all. This means the VRAM is not memory mapped and
the CPU cannot access it directly. Instead, VRAM access can only be done
through the GPU. Fortunately, transfers are done via high speed DMA.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, the GPU uses the VRAM for storing framebuffers and texture images.
The most interesting aspect about the VRAM is how the GPU treats it like a
1024x512 16-bit image, with areas of VRAM addressed by (X,Y) coordinates
instead of a linear memory address range. Display and drawing framebuffers as
well as texture images reside as rectangular images in the VRAM. The following
illustrates a typical VRAM layout for framebuffers and texture images in PSX
games.
</p>
<img src="/chapter1/images/vram-layout.svg">

<h3>Primitive Packets</h3>
<p>
The GPU is instructed through the use of primitive packets, which are small
bits of formatted data that make up a GPU command which are sent to the GPU
via DMA for drawing. The primitive packets not only specify the type of
primitive but also the color, semi-transparency flags, (X,Y) coordinates,
texture coordinates, color look-up table to use and so forth. Think of them
like arguments for a function call.
</p>
<p>
The number of arguments a primitive packet requires depends on the type of
primitive. The simplest primitives such as a texture page primitive only takes
one argument while the most sophisticated primitive; a texture mapped, gouraud
shaded, 4-point polygon takes as many as 14 arguments. This also means the
size of the primitive varies, with the texture page primitive being only a
word in size while a 4-point, texture mapped and gouraud shaded polygon is
12 words long on top of the tag word present at the start of all primitives.
</p>
<p>
Further details about primitive packets will be covered in a future chapter.
</p>

<h3>Framebuffers</h3>
<p>
Framebuffers for graphics display and drawing reside in VRAM as rectangular
areas defined in (X,Y) coordinates. The size of the display area is based on
the video mode (ie. the display area is 320x240 pixels when running in
320x240 mode). On the other hand, the size for the drawing area can be of any
arbitrary size which may be used to render texture images for accomplishing
certain render to texture based visual effects. Normally, the size of the
drawing area should typically be equal to the display area.
</p>
<p>
The display and drawing areas are defined as an environment using the
<b>DISPENV</b> and <b>DRAWENV</b> structs. Each struct defines various
parameters that are relevant to their respective environment. The
<b>DISPENV</b> and <b>DRAWENV</b> structs are initialized using
<b>SetDefDispEnv()</b> and <b>SetDefDrawEnv()</b> respectively which defines
the default parameters for each environment, which may be customized later for
your project's requirements. Once the environments have been defined they can
then be applied to the GPU using <b>PutDispEnv()</b> and <b>PutDrawEnv()</b>
to make each environment effective.
</p>
<p>
Learning the display and drawing environments are mandatory for being able to
get any graphical output from the PSX and this will be covered extensively in
this chapter.
</p>

<h2 id="hellostart">Writing the Hello World Program</h2>
<p>
As obligatory as it may sound, a hello world is an effective and simple enough
example to get started with PSX homebrew programming. A hello world program for
the PSX can't be a simple call of printf(), unless you only want to see the
output through a tty which, in all honesty, won't look as interesting as
showing the message on the TV screen or emulator window.
</p>
<p>
The basic run-down of accomplishing a hello world on the PSX is to perform the
following operations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Initialize the GPU.</li>
<li>Define display and drawing environments.</li>
<li>Initializing the debug font.</li>
<li>Display the hello world text.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Break out your preferred text editor and begin writing the hello world program
as you go along this chapter.
</p>

<h3>Required Headers</h3>
<p>
First, include some necessary headers in your C file. The most important of which is
libgpu.h as it provides various definitions provided by the libgpu library. libgte.h
is required even if you don't plan to use the GTE as libgpu.h depends on some
definitions provided in it.
</p>
<pre>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;	// This provides typedefs needed by libgte.h and libgpu.h
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;	// Not necessary but include it anyway
#include &lt;libetc.h&gt;	// Includes some functions that controls the display
#include &lt;libgte.h&gt;	// GTE header, not really used but libgpu.h depends on it
#include &lt;libgpu.h&gt;	// GPU library header
</pre>
<p>
If using PSn00bSDK, replace the <b>lib</b> prefix with <b>psx</b> instead. Most
of the definitions between the official SDK and PSn00bSDK are identical, so the
syntax of things shouldn't be much to worry much about.
</p>

<h3>Write the main() Function</h3>
<p>
Like with any C program, you must define a main() function somewhere in your
project. You can omit the argc and argv definitions if desired as they don't
work on the PSX.
</p>
<pre>int main()
{
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
A return value cannot be passed to a parent executable as the kernel does not
save the value for the caller to receive it, but is required nonetheless to
keep the compiler from complaining about returning without a value.
</p>


<h2 id="gpusetup">Setting up Graphics</h2>
<p>
The very first thing to do before anything else in your PSX program is to
call <b>ResetGraph()</b>. <b>ResetGraph()</b> not only resets the GPU as the
name suggests, but it also enables interrupts which are mandatory for getting
anything done on the PSX. If <b>ResetGraph()</b> is not called functions that
depend on interrupts such as <b>VSync()</b> and several other things will not
work, and will usually appear as though your program just crashed.
</p>
<pre>// Reset GPU and enable interrupts
ResetGraph(0);
</pre>
<p>
Resetting the GPU also masks out the video output which results in a black
screen, but the console still produces video sync. The video output is enabled
again using <b>SetDispMask()</b>, ideally after a <b>DISPENV</b> has been
defined and applied to the GPU for a smooth transition from a previously
running program (ie. the startup screen). As <b>ResetGraph()</b> does not clear
the contents of VRAM, so whatever was drawn by the previous program still
remains when your program takes over. Clearing the VRAM is generally not
required in most well coded scenarios.
</p>

<h3>Setting up the DISPENV and DRAWENV Environments</h3>
<p>
Start by defining two <b>DISPENV</b> and <b>DRAWENV</b> variables as arrays in
your code. Define an int which will be used for keeping track of things which
will make total sense later on. This value must be set to zero as part of your
graphics initialization code just to make sure the variable starts with a value
of zero.
</p>
<pre>// Define environment pairs and buffer counter
DISPENV disp[2];
DRAWENV draw[2];
int db;
</pre>
<p>
Next is to define the <b>DISPENV</b> pair. Initializing the <b>DISPENV</b>
structure is easiest done using the <b>SetDefDispEnv()</b> function with simple
arguments.
</p>
<b>For NTSC users:</b>
<pre>// Configures the pair of DISPENVs for 320x240 mode (NTSC)
SetDefDispEnv(&amp;disp;[0], 0, 0, 320, 240);
SetDefDispEnv(&amp;disp;[1], 0, 240, 320, 240);
</pre>
<b>For PAL users:</b>
<pre>// Configures the pair of DISPENVs for 320x256 mode (PAL)
SetDefDispEnv(&amp;disp;[0], 0, 0, 320, 256);
SetDefDispEnv(&amp;disp;[1], 0, 256, 320, 256);

// Screen offset to center the picture vertically
disp[0].screen.y = 24;
disp[1].screen.y = disp[0].screen.y;

// Forces PAL video standard
SetVideoMode(MODE_PAL);
</pre>
<p>
This defines both <b>DISPENV</b>s for 320x240 resolution mode (320x256 if you
used the PAL snippet) which is the most commonly used video mode. The first
<b>DISPENV</b> is set with a position of (0,0) while the second <b>DISPENV</b>
is set with a VRAM offset of (0,240). You might be wondering why it has to be
defined that way.
</p>
<p>
Next is to define the <b>DRAWENV</b>s. Much like the <b>DISPENV</b>s you use
<b>SetDefDrawEnv()</b> to initialize the <b>DRAWENV</b> structure with
simple arguments.
</p>
<b>For NTSC users:</b>
<pre>// Configures the pair of DRAWENVs for the DISPENVs
SetDefDrawEnv(&amp;draw;[0], 0, 240, 320, 240);
SetDefDrawEnv(&amp;draw;[1], 0, 0, 320, 240);
</pre>
<b>For PAL users:</b>
<pre>// Configures the pair of DRAWENVs for the DISPENVs
SetDefDrawEnv(&amp;draw;[0], 0, 256, 320, 256);
SetDefDrawEnv(&amp;draw;[1], 0, 0, 320, 256);
</pre>
<p>
Unlike <b>DISPENV</b>, <b>DRAWENV</b> can be of any arbitrary size for the
drawing environment. But generally it should be equal to the size of the
<b>DISPENV</b> defined, so the drawn area will align perfectly with the display
environments. Additionally, you'll want to set some parameters within the
<b>DRAWENV</b> struct to enable background clearing as otherwise you'll get a
hall of mirrors effect. The background clear takes effect as soon as the
<b>DRAWENV</b> is applied to the GPU using <b>PutDrawEnv()</b>.
</p>
<pre>// Specifies the clear color of the DRAWENV
setRGB0(&amp;draw;[0], 63, 0, 127);
setRGB0(&amp;draw;[1], 63, 0, 127);
// Enable background clear
draw[0].isbg = 1;
draw[1].isbg = 1;
</pre>
<p>
Finally, apply the <b>DISPENV</b>/<b>DRAWENV</b> environments to the GPU to
apply the new video mode and drawing environment to achieve a seamless
transition.
</p>
<pre>// Apply environments
PutDispEnv(&amp;disp;[0]);
PutDrawEnv(&amp;draw;[0]);
</pre>
<p>
To keep your code look neat and tidy, you'll want to put all the graphics init
code inside a function, to keep your <b>main()</b> function from looking messy
and will make expanding the program easier in the future.
</p>

<h3>The Concept of Double Buffered Rendering</h3>
<p>
You may have noticed that the <b>DRAWENV</b> pairs are somewhat positioned in
the opposite order as the <b>DISPENV</b> whilst writing the graphics init code
and are probably wondering why this is the case instead of a <b>DRAWENV</b>
directly overlapping a <b>DISPENV</b>. This is how you implement double
buffered rendering on the PSX and is a standard feature to have when writing
real-time graphics code, not just on the PSX but on almost any system with a
framebuffer.
</p>
<p>
If you're not familiar with the concept, you basically need to allocate two
framebuffer areas; one for display and one for drawing. The way you use these
framebuffers is you use one buffer as the display buffer, which is the buffer
the graphics hardware will display on the screen and the other as the drawing
buffer, where all your graphics operations should draw to and is not shown on
the screen. Once drawing is complete the two buffers switch places, the drawing
buffer becomes the display buffer and the display buffer become the drawing
buffer for the next frame to be drawn and the cycle repeats. This basically
guarantees that only completed frames are shown on the screen which yields
seamless graphical animations even during framerate drops when intensive
visuals are being drawn aside from the natural reduction of smoothness.
</p>
<img src="/chapter1/images/bufferlayout.svg">
<p>
Having a <b>DISPENV</b> and a <b>DRAWENV</b> simply overlap one another on the
same area counts as single buffered rendering and whilst you may get away with
it, the amount of things you can draw/process will be severely limited as you'll
get nasty flicker if the drawing/processing does not complete before the v-blank
period ends. So, a double buffered rendering scheme is much preferred.
</p>

<h3>The Display Function</h3>
<p>
Now the last thing that deals with the <b>DISPENV</b> and <b>DRAWENV</b>
environments to write is a so called display function, which is basically
a function that does the all buffer swap stuff in a single call for
convenience. Calling the display function should be done at the end of your
loop as that is usually where all graphics operations have completed
and are ready for drawing or display. For this tutorial, the display function
will be named <h>display()</h>.
</p>
<p>
Before performing a buffer swap, you must first call <b>DrawSync()</b> then
<b>VSync()</b>. As the names suggests these functions waits for the GPU to
complete any drawing operations and waits for the vertical blanking period
respectively. Waiting for <b>DrawSync()</b> is important as it makes sure that
the GPU has completed drawing any primitives as otherwise you may get flicker
or possibly instability. Waiting for <b>VSync()</b> is also important as it
not only caps your program loop to the TV refresh rate (60fps for NTSC, 50
for PAL) but it also prevents screen tearing which will happen if you swap
buffers without waiting for the v-blank period.
</p>
<pre>// Wait for GPU to finish drawing and V-Blank
DrawSync(0);
VSync(0);
</pre>
<p>
Now the next step is to perform the buffer swap. If you remember that variable
named <h>db</h> earlier, this variable will be used as a counter to keep track
of which buffer pair to switch to. Since there are only two <b>DISPENV</b> and
<b>DRAWENV</b> pairs this variable will simply alternate between 1 and 0 on
every call of the display function. This easily achieved using a NOT (!)
operator.
</p>
<pre>// Flip buffer counter
db = !db;
</pre>
<p>
Then apply the environment pair based on the value of <h>db</h> to the GPU.
</p>
<pre>// Apply environments
PutDispEnv(&amp;disp;[db]);
PutDrawEnv(&amp;draw;[db]);
</pre>
<p>
And finally, call <b>SetDispMask()</b> to lift the display mask so you get
picture instead of a black screen, as <b>ResetGraph()</b> masks the display
by default.
</p>
<pre>// Enable display
SetDispMask(1);
</pre>

<h3>Verifying the Code</h3>
<p>
To make sure you're right on track, here's a listing of what the code should
look like.
</p>
<pre>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;	// This provides typedefs needed by libgte.h and libgpu.h
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;	// Not necessary but include it anyway
#include &lt;libetc.h&gt;	// Includes some functions that controls the display
#include &lt;libgte.h&gt;	// GTE header, not really used but libgpu.h depends on it
#include &lt;libgpu.h&gt;	// GPU library header

// Define environment pairs and buffer counter
DISPENV disp[2];
DRAWENV draw[2];
int db;

void init(void)
{
    // Reset GPU and enable interrupts
    ResetGraph(0);
    
    // Configures the pair of DISPENVs for 320x240 mode (NTSC)
    SetDefDispEnv(&amp;disp;[0], 0, 0, 320, 240);
    SetDefDispEnv(&amp;disp;[1], 0, 240, 320, 240);
    
    // Configures the pair of DRAWENVs for the DISPENVs
    SetDefDrawEnv(&amp;draw;[0], 0, 240, 320, 240);
    SetDefDrawEnv(&amp;draw;[1], 0, 0, 320, 240);
    
    // Specifies the clear color of the DRAWENV
    setRGB0(&amp;draw;[0], 63, 0, 127);
    setRGB0(&amp;draw;[1], 63, 0, 127);
    
    // Enable background clear
    draw[0].isbg = 1;
    draw[1].isbg = 1;
    
    // Apply environments
    PutDispEnv(&amp;disp;[0]);
    PutDrawEnv(&amp;draw;[0]);

    // Make sure db starts with zero
    db = 0;
}

void display(void)
{
    // Wait for GPU to finish drawing and V-Blank
    DrawSync(0);
    VSync(0);
    
    // Flip buffer counter
    db = !db;
    
    // Apply environments
    PutDispEnv(&amp;disp;[db]);
    PutDrawEnv(&amp;draw;[db]);
    
    // Enable display
    SetDispMask(1);
}

int main()
{
    // Initialize graphics and stuff
    init();
    
    // Main loop
    while(1)
    {
        display();
    }
    
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<h3>Compiling and Testing</h3>
<p>Now that you've written a considerable amount of code for the graphics
init and buffer swapping stuff, it should be possible to compile the code
and see an output to check if you're right on track. In the official
PsyQ/Programmers' Tool SDK compiling can be done through <b>ccpsx</b> with
a single command line. <b>ccpsx</b> is actually a front for the C, C++ and
linker that makes using the SDK's toolchain easier.
</p>
<pre>ccpsx -O2 -Xo0x80010000 hello.c -o hello.cpe
</pre>
<p>
If you've worked with C before, you should already know that <h>-O2</h>
specifies the optimization level for the compiler generated code just like
in most other C compilers. The <h>-Xo0x80010000</h> parameter would likely
be unfamiliar to you and this specifies the target address your executable's
program text is going to reside when it is being loaded by the console.
The target address is usually set to 0x80010000 which is the start of user
space memory on the PSX as the first 64KB is reserved by the kernel.
</p>
<p>
The executables <b>ccpsx</b> produces are in CPE format which cannot be
booted from the CD by the PSX and most emulators don't support it. You'll
have to convert the executable into the usable PS-EXE format which can be
done using <b>cpe2x</b>.
</p>
<pre>cpe2x hello.cpe
</pre>
<p>Don't be fooled by the .EXE file extension of a PS-EXE executable file. The
executable files <b>cpe2x</b> produces are neither MS-DOS or Windows
executable programs.
</p>
<p>If using PSn00bSDK. It is more complicated to compile a program from within
the command line alone due to the way how the toolchain is currently set up.
It is much easier to just copy a makefile from one of the examples included
in the SDK and tweak the variables for your project. Then use <b>make</b>
to compile the program and it should produce an ELF file and a PS-EXE file.
</p>
<p>Run the program and you should get a solid blue image.

<h2 id="hellodisplay">Displaying the Hello World</h2>
<p>Now that the graphics environment and display routines have been implemented,
the next step is to draw the hello world message. This is easily done by using
the debug font functions <b>FntLoad()</b>, <b>FntOpen()</b> and
<b>FntPrint()</b>. These functions are not suited for general use. Such as in
a game title as it does not support any form of customization and does not
support lowercase letters, but is good enough for testing and debugging
purposes which will be useful later. These functions are provided by libetc,
or psxetc in PSn00bSDK.
</p>

<h3>Setting up the Debug Font</h3>
<p>The first thing to do before the debug font functions can be used is to is
load the font texture onto VRAM using <b>FntLoad()</b>. The font texture can be
placed anywhere in the VRAM area provided it doesn't get overwritten by
display/draw areas, or textures being loaded onto VRAM. For this tutorial, the
font texture will be placed at (960,0).
</p>
<p>Next is to create a text stream using <b>FntOpen()</b> which defines the
area where the text will be drawn at. For this tutorial a text stream of 100
characters is defined to fill the entire screen, with some overscan
compensation to ensure that the text is visible on the TV.
</p>
<pre>// Load the internal font texture
FntLoad(960, 0);
// Create the text stream

<p>The font area coordinates are draw-area relative and not VRAM relative, so
there is no need to define another font area for each of the display/draw areas
in the VRAM. The third argument specifies if a black background for the font
area should be drawn. In PSn00bSDK, you can specify 2 for a semi-transparent
black background. If you try to set it to a non-zero value, the background will
turn black because the font area covers the entire screen.
</p>
<p><b>FntOpen()</b> allows defining multiple font areas by saving the return
value to a persistent variable and passing it as the first argument of
<b>FntPrint()</b> and <b>FntFlush()</b>. Up to eight font areas can be defined
at once, but it cannot be closed or redefined later in your program.
</p>
<h3>Printing and Displaying Hello World</h3>
<p><b>FntPrint()</b> prints text to the last defined font area and works more
or less like <b>printf()</b> and you can also use the newline character
sequence <h>\n</h> to move a line of text down. A font handle can be specified
as an optional first argument of <b>FntPrint()</b>, but in PSn00bSDK a handle
from <b>FntOpen()</b> or -1 must be specified as the first argument. This
</p>
<pre>FntPrint("HELLO WORLD!");

FntFlush(-1);
display();
</pre>
<p>Calling <b>FntPrint()</b> alone is not enough to display text to the
current draw area, so <b>FntFlush()</b> needs to be called to actually draw
the characters printed from <b>FntPrint()</b> calls.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This concludes this chapter of Lameguy64's PSX Tutorial series. You should
be very familiar of how framebuffers are handled on the PSX hardware and
should be ready to take on drawing proper graphics primitives.</p>
<p>A few things you may want to experiment with this example yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try ordering the areas side by side.</li>
<li>Go to the VRAM/GPU Viewer in no$psx or press F12 in PSXfin to visually
see the buffers in action. This also works for retail games.</li>
<li>Play around with the clear color values on the <b>DRAWENV</b> environments.
Make sure the color values on both <b>DRAWENV</b> elements are the same
otherwise intense flickering will occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next tutorial will cover how to draw graphics with the GPU using
ordering tables and primitive packets.</p>
