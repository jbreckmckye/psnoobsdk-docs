<h1>Chapter 1.6: Using the CD-ROM</h1>

<p>So you've managed to make it this far in this tutorial series and have
wrapped your head around uploading textures to VRAM, drawing sprite
primitives with the GPU, handling controller input and rotating sprites
using fixed-point integer math, you should be good to go at making a simple
game with the knowledge you've gained so far. However, there's one more thing
to learn that's very important to know in this endeavor before going forward
and that is using the CD-ROM.</p>

<p>The most obvious use of the CD-ROM drive on the PlayStation is, well, to
load data files from of course. Such files range from texture images, to
level data and even your program executable that the console loads during
the boot process. You can only go so far by including resources into your
PS-EXE as the console only has 2 megabytes worth of RAM, and more
importantly, they take up memory space that cannot be reclaimed even when
they are no longer needed (ie. texture images).</p>

<p>This chapter goes over the basic usage and operation of the CD-ROM library
for reading files from the CD-ROM.</p>

<p><b>Compatible with PSn00bSDK:</b> Yes</p>

<h2 id="workins">Workings of the CD-ROM</h2>

<p>Before going into the know-abouts on using the CD-ROM we shall first
look into a brief explanation of how the CD-ROM format works, as
understanding some of the inner workings of the format will aid you
greatly in understanding the CD-ROM drive as you develop software for
the PlayStation.</p>

<h3>CD-ROM Structure</h3>

<p>A CD-ROM typically consists of a Table-of-Contents or TOC
and a huge spiral track that spans the entire surface of the disc containing
sectors of binary data running along the track. The TOC contains information
about the location of tracks written on the disc, their pregap and their
type of track, a track in this case being the track number to your favorite
song in a music CD. The TOC would also contain information of the next
writable location in multi-session discs, which would in turn contain
another TOC of the next session but this only really applies to CD-R
discs.</p>

<p>PlayStation game discs typically contain only one track, with the exception
of games, usually early titles, using Red Book CD Audio tracks for music
immediately after the first data track of the disc.</p>

<h3>CD-ROM Sectors</h3>

<p>A CD-ROM sector is a small data block of 2352 bytes but this only
applies to plain CD audio tracks, as the usable sector size is reduced
to 2048 bytes for data storage (ie. files). The remaining space of the
CD-ROM sector is taken up by sync and address bytes used to allow for
precise logical block addressing of the disc, alongside error detection
and correcting codes to help maintain data integrity of each data sector.
This sector format is known as Mode1, with a similar format used by the
PlayStation being Mode2/Form1 from the CD-ROM XA specification as used
by the Philips CD-i.</p>

<p>As far as the PlayStation is concerned, the console only reads
the data part of the sector on data reads, with the sync/address
and EDC/ECC correction handled transparently by the hardware
unless instructed to ignore EDC/ECC correction on data reads or
to read whole sectors including their EDC/ECC data.</p>

<h3>CD-ROM XA Extensions</h3>

<p>As the PlayStation inherits the CD-ROM XA features from the CD-i as Sony
co-developed the Green Book standard with Philips, the console supports
playing back of special ADPCOM compressed audio tracks, most commonly known
as XA audio.</p>

<p>XA audio are basically special audio tracks compressed using ADPCM, with
a maximum sample rate of 37.8KHz mono or stereo. Unlike regular Red Book CD
Audio tracks XA audio tracks are interleaved with eight different audio
tracks at once (the interleave can be doubled, tripled and quadrupled by
using mono and/or 18.9KHz sample rate) and is played at double the speed of
plain CD Audio. However, the hardware only supports playing one audio 
channel at a time.</p>

<p>This has some advantages, for one the drive does not need to change speed
when going from audio playback to data reading which can help improve load
times. Secondly, XA audio tracks take up less space overall especially when
the XA audio data is laid out properly (ie. all audio channels are of roughly
the same length to one another). Thirdly, XA audio data can be interleaved
with data sectors, and is used for video playback. The Data/XA Audio interleave
also explains why some files on a PlayStation game disc (usually .STR video
files) cannot be accessed directly under most computer operating systems,
usually resulting in read errors.</p>

<p>However, XA audio has one downside and that is it tends to skip during
normal playback more than when playing back regular CD Audio tracks.</p>

<p>There is one more feature of XA audio that's seldom used and that is
channel switching during playback. This would be useful for adding dynamic
music to a game by switching to different channels of different tangents
of a level theme depending on the area the player is currently at. One game
that makes use of this feature is Klonoa: Door to Phantomile.</p>

<h3>The 650MB Limit</h3>

<p>Even though the PlayStation can read 700MB discs it cannot read more
than 650MB of the disc as the console's CD-ROM controller does not take
larger discs into account, as the console was designed before such discs
ever existed and the original CD-ROM specification specifies 650MB as the
standard capacity.</p>

<h2 id="waystoaccess">Ways of Accessing the CD-ROM</h2>

<p>There are two possible methods for accessing the CD-ROM of the PlayStation
that will work on both PsyQ/Programmer's Tool and PSn00bSDK. The first method
and one that is seldom used is the CD-ROM functions included in the console's
BIOS, which consists of calling <b>_96_init()</b> to initialize the BIOS
CD-ROM subsystem and using the BIOS file I/O functions such as <b>open()</b>
and <b>read()</b> with the <h>cdrom:</h> device name. Whilst this method is
technically the most efficient option as it does not introduce any code
overhead to your PlayStation project as the functions already reside in the
console itself, the BIOS CD-ROM functions are rather limited and in a good
number of cases, unstable.</p>

<p>For one, calling <b>_96_init()</b> clears all but the DMA channel for the
CD-ROM controller, breaking the GPU library unless you call the function before
<b>ResetGraph()</b>. The BIOS functions are also quite slow and does not
support asynchronous reads, even though the hardware itself clearly supports
such operations. It does not even support playing CD Audio nor XA audio tracks
directly, so a different method is often most desired.</p>

<p>The other, more preferable method is to use the CD-ROM library called
<h>libcd</h> in PsyQ/Programmer's Tool and <h>psxcd</h> in PSn00bSDK
respectively. Not only is it faster and more stable than the BIOS CD-ROM
functions at the cost of some overhead, but it also offers greater control
of the CD-ROM hardware as well. Playing CD Audio and XA audio included.</p>

<h2 id="usinglib">Using the CD-ROM Library</h2>

<p>Using the CD-ROM library is quite simple in principle. The first thing
to be done is to initialize the CD-ROM library by calling the function
<b>CdInit()</b>. This function not only initializes the CD-ROM hardware
but also the CD-ROM library itself.</p>

<h3 id="cdinit">Initializing the CD-ROM</h3>

<p>After calling <b>ResetGraph()</b> in your init routine you can then call
<b>CdInit()</b> to initialize the CD-ROM library.</p>

<pre>int CdInit(void)
</pre>

<p>The behavior of this function is very identical in both SDKs, but the
PsyQ/Programmers Tool implementation insists that a CD must be inserted
otherwise the function will output a lot of error messages to stdout and
fail to initialize. PSn00bSDK's implementation does not throw errors
when no disc is inserted, as it is written with utility style programs
that don't always need to read the disc in mind.</p>

<p>After calling this function, all CD-ROM functions exposed by the library
should be usable.</p>

<h3 id="locatefile">Locating a File</h3>

<p>Now that the CD-ROM library is initialized the next step is to locate a
file on the disc to be read. Unlike the BIOS CD-ROM functions, the CD-ROM
library does not have a concept of file handles and instead, files are
read directly from their logical position on the disc. Conveniently, no
files on a CD-ROM are fragmented so file read operations from the CD-ROM
are quite simple and pretty straight forward.</p>

<p>Locating a file on the disc is done by using <b>CdSearchFile()</b>.</p>

<pre>CdlFILE* CdSearchFile(const char *filename, CdlFILE *loc)
</pre>

<p>This function will search the CD-ROM file system for the file specified
by <i>filename</i> and stores information about the file, such as it's
logical position and file size, to a <b>CdlFILE</b> struct specified by
<i>loc</i>. This information is all we need to read a file from the disc.
The file name must contain an absolute path from the root directory of
the disc as the CD-ROM library has no concept of current directories. The
file path must additionally end with a file version identifier, usually
<h>;1</h>.</p>

<p>The return value is just a pointer to the struct specified by <i>loc</i>,
but NULL is returned if the file name specified does not exist.</p>

<h3 id="readfile">Reading a File</h3>

<p>Now that the file we want to read has been located, the next logical step
is to read it's contents. This is done by using two CD-ROM functions;
<b>CdControl()</b> and <b>CdRead()</b>.</p>

<p><b>CdControl()</b> is kind of a multi-purpose function as it is used
to issue raw commands directly to the console's CD-ROM controller and
can be used to make the controller do all kinds of things including
CD audio playback, but this will be covered in greater detail at a later
chapter.</p>

<p>For this instance, we'll be using <b>CdControl()</b> to issue a
<b>CdlSetloc</b> command to the CD-ROM controller with the location of the
file we just located.</p>

<pre>int CdControl(u_char com, u_char *param, u_char *result);
</pre>

<p><i>com</i> specifies the command to be issued (<b>CdlSetloc</b> in this
case) while <i>param</i> should be a pointer to the <i>loc</i> element in
the <b>CdlFILE</b> struct we obtained from the <b>CdSearchFile()</b> call
earlier. <i>result</i> can be ignored in this instance so NULL can be
specified for that argument. <i>result</i> is where return data from the
CD-ROM controller would be stored to if a small buffer is specified.</p>

<p>The reason we must issue a <b>CdlSetloc</b> command is it sets the
target location for a read, seek or play operation. The CD-ROM hardware
does not yet move it's optical pickup when <b>CdlSetloc</b> is issued
alone, seeking only occurs when either of the aforementioned disc
operations have been issued and that a target location set by issuing
<b>CdlSetloc</b> was set prior.</p>

<p>And finally, we can now start a read operation by calling the
<b>CdRead()</b> function.</p>

<pre>int CdRead(int sectors, unsigned int *buf, int mode)
</pre>

<p>As the name says it all, this function starts a data read operation from
the disc starting from the logical position specified by a previously issued
<b>CdlSetloc</b> command. <i>sectors</i> specifies the number of sectors to
read from the disc, the exact number can be determined by taking the
<i>size</i> field in the <b>CdlFILE</b> struct, adding it by 2047 then
divide by 2048. More will be explained why it had to be computed that way
later. The sectors read are then stored to <i>buf</i>, which
must point to a buffer large enough to contain all the sectors to be read.
<i>mode</i> specifies the CD-ROM mode to use for the read operation, usually
<b>CdlModeSpeed</b> is needed for all file read operations so data is read
at full speed.</p>

<p>If you haven't guessed from the brief explanation of the operation of
CD-ROMs earlier in this chapter, each sector is 2048 bytes long. And because
<b>CdRead()</b> only reads in sector units you can only read data in
multiples of 2048 bytes. The logical position of files stored on the CD-ROM
are also addressed in multiples of 2048 bytes.</p>

<p>The BIOS CD-ROM functions are also limited to reading files in units of
2048 bytes and file seeks are limited to multiples of 2048 bytes as well.
Because of this, it is much faster to just load the entirety of a file into
memory and parse the file from there, especially as performing several small
seeks and read operations would be quite slow, even moreso as the
PlayStation's CD-ROM hardware doesn't have very fast access times.</p>

<p>Once <b>CdRead()</b> has been called and the PlayStation's optical pickup
seeks to the file's location and begins reading data, the memory buffer
specified for <i>buf</i> should start filling with data from the file being
read. However, the <b>CdRead()</b> function finishes almost immediately and
the buffer may not yet contain the file you're reading yet, so another step
is required to make sure the buffer is filled with all the contents of the
file you want to load.</p>

<pre>int CdReadSync(int mode, unsigned char *result)
</pre>

<p>This function will wait until the <b>CdRead()</b> operation is actually
completed if <i>mode</i> is set to zero. If it is non-zero the function
returns the number of sectors remaining in the read operation. This is
useful if you want to have a animated loading screen or some such.
If a buffer is specified in <i>result</i> the most recent CD-ROM status
is written to that buffer, but it can be left NULL if not needed.</p>

<p>The asynchronous nature of the <b>CdRead()</b> function may be utilized
for implemented animated loading screens and such.</p>

<h3>Finished Routine</h3>

<p>With all that taken in, a simple CD-ROM read routine should like this.</p>

<pre>CdlFILE filePos;
int     numsecs;
char    *buff;

/* locate the file on the CD */
if( CdSearchFile( &amp;filePos;, "\\TEXTURE.TIM;1" ) == NULL )
{
    /* print error message if file not found */
    printf( "File was not found." );
}
else
{
    /* calculate number of sectors to read for the file */
    numsecs = (filePos.size+2047)/2048;
    
    /* allocate buffer for the file */
    buff = (char*)malloc( 2048*numsecs );
    
    /* set read target to the file */
    CdControl( CdlSetloc, (u_char*)&amp;filePos.loc;, 0 );
    
    /* start read operation */
    CdRead( numsecs, (u_long*)buff, CdlModeSpeed );
    
    /* wait until the read operation is complete */
    CdReadSync( 0, 0 );
}
</pre>

<p>You may notice that the file size has to be incremented by 2047
then divided by 2048. This is to make sure that the sector count calculated
would cover the entirety of a file that is not a perfect multiple of 2048
bytes. If the file to be read were like 1536 bytes, the whole file would be
read as one whole sector with the excess bytes being nothing more but
padding.</p>

<p>You also have to remember that data reads from the CD are still multiples
of 2048 bytes, so the read buffer must be allocated in multiples of 2048 bytes
to avoid buffer overflow bugs, which would in turn trash the memory heap.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>To keep things simple we'll just implement it on top of the exisitng
sample program from the last chapter. Basically instead of reading the
sample texture from an array we'll load the texture file from the CD-ROM.
This can be quickly implemented by implementing our CD-ROM file read routine
as a nice little function.</p>

<pre>char *loadfile( const char *filename )
{
    CdlFILE filePos;
    int     numsecs;
    char    *buff;
    
    buff = NULL;
    
    /* locate the file on the CD */
    if( CdSearchFile( filename, &amp;filePos; ) == NULL )
    {
        /* print error message if file not found */
        printf( "%s not found.", filename );
    }
    else
    {
        /* calculate number of sectors to read for the file */
        numsecs = (filePos.size+2047)/2048;
        
        /* allocate buffer for the file (replace with malloc3() for PsyQ) */
        buff = (char*)malloc( 2048*numsecs );
        
        /* set read target to the file */
        CdControl( CdlSetloc, (u_char*)&amp;filePos.loc;, 0 );
        
        /* start read operation */
        CdRead( numsecs, (u_long*)buff, CdlModeSpeed );
        
        /* wait until the read operation is complete */
        CdReadSync( 0, 0 );
    }
    
    return( buff );
    
} /* loadfile */
</pre>

<p>The sample program from the last chapter will be used to demonstrate the
usage of the function, to load the texture image from CD rather than loading
from an array. The ever growing sample program should be like this. Tweak
the code as you see fit to make it work with the SDK you're using.</p>

<h2 id="makecd">Creating the CD Image</h2>

<p>Once you've got the code above compiled it won't do jack for now as it
doesn't yet have a CD to read the texture file from. This is where disc
image creation comes to play in this chapter.</p>

<p>In the old days, the only preferred way to create PlayStation CD images
was with the old, MS-DOS based BUILDCD tool from the old leaked PsyQ SDK
dump. This tool is quite difficult to use on modern computers these days
largely due to being a 16-bit MS-DOS program, and while Dosbox can be used
to get it going on a modern machine it is not exactly ideal, not to mention
is very slow.</p>

<p>To make image creation even more tedious with the old BUILDCD method
the resulting image file is of a special format intended for early CD
burners and special disc cutters, so another tool called STRIPISO is
used to convert the image file to that of a usable file format. However,
the conversion process does not convert the Table-of-Contents data
produced by BUILDCD as well, so having multiple tracks in the disc image
was not possible with this method.</p>

<p>While other, more conventional means of disc image creation like
MKISOFS would work, it is not exactly ideal for projects that use XA
audio or streaming data which require support for mixed Mode2/Form1
and Mode2/Form2 not supported by MKISOFS so you'd be stuck with having
to use BUILDCD in the old days. Well... That is until
<a href="https://github.com/lameguy64/mkpsxiso">MKPSXISO</a> by
yours truly came about, solving this disc image creation dilemma in the
PlayStation homebrew scene once and for all. Said tool was so useful that
it got used quite extensively around ROM hacking and game translation
groups... Or so I heard.</p>

<h3>Creating a MKPSXISO Script</h3>

<p>Kind of like BUILDCD, MKPSXISO uses a simple script system to define
the contents and layout of a CD image. However, it uses a XML based
format similar to that you'd find in HTML webpage files, of which, in
of itself is quite simple especially if you use a good text editor
such as Notepad++ or nedit.</p>

<p>The following is a link to a sample XML script for this tutorial.
You must save the link as a file as otherwise your browser's going to
treat it as a web page. The file also contains comments that explains
the usage of the XML file.</p>

<a href="/chapter1/mkpsxiso-sample.xml">MKPSXISO Sample Script</a>

<p>The script file assumes that the above C program is compiled as
<b>cdread.exe</b>.</p>

<h3>Creating the SYSTEM.CNF File</h3>

<p>Before the ISO image can be created, a <b>SYSTEM.CNF</b> file must be
created and is a standard requirement for PlayStation game discs to include.
The <b>SYSTEM.CNF</b> file is a simple text file that defines a few
parameters. The most important being the <b>BOOT</b> variable.</p>

<pre>BOOT=cdrom:\cdread.exe;1
TCB=4
EVENT=10
STACK=801FFFF0
</pre>

<p>The parameters that immediately follow it <b>TCB</b>, <b>EVENT</b> and
<b>STACK</b> are special parameters that change the way how the kernel
is set up for the game. The parameters in the sample script are typical
values used in most games, so they can be left alone.</p>

<p>Save the text file as <b>SYSTEM.TXT</b> as the script provided will
rename it as <b>SYSTEM.CNF</b> as the disc image gets created. This is
done so that editing the CNF file is made easier when need-be, such as
changing the executable name.</p>

<h3>Creating the disc image</h3>

<p>Building the disc image with MKPSXISO is just a matter of simply
invoking it from the command line with the XML script as the argument.

</p><pre>mkpsxiso mkpsxiso-sample.xml
</pre>

<p>If things go accordingly you should end up with a BIN/CUE image pair
named <b>cdtutorial</b>. Run the disc image in your preferred emulator
and the program from the last tutorial should work now, only there's now
a slight delay from loading data from the disc.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Hopefully this chapter has cleared up a lot of things in regards to
reading data from the CD, something I feel is still not explained very
well. But then I haven't really kept up with the PlayStation homebrew
scene in a very long while. In the future, stuff like CD Audio and XA
audio playback will be covered.</p>

<p>And this concludes the basics chapter of this tutorial series, and
if you've managed to reach this far after reading the first few chapters
you should be able to do quite a bit with 2D stuff on the console now...
Provided you managed to absorb it all.</p>
